# DMV Data Analysis POC
This repository contains a proof of concept for using transformer models to analyze and process data related to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). 

## Contents
- `DMV_test.pdf`: Contains test cases or data related to DMV processes.
- `DMV_using_transformers_pipeline.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook demonstrating the use of transformer models in a pipeline for analyzing DMV data.

## Getting Started
To run the Jupyter notebook, you'll need to install certain Python packages, such as transformers, pandas, and jupyter. This can typically be done via pip:
Then, you can launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and open the `.ipynb` file to view the analysis.
## Purpose
The purpose of this POC is to showcase how advanced machine learning techniques, specifically transformer models, can be applied to improve the efficiency and accuracy of data processing and analysis in the domain of motor vehicle management.
