# Advanced DMV Data Analysis POC
This repository houses a Proof of Concept (POC) designed to showcase the application of advanced data analysis techniques, including transformer models and TF-IDF with cosine similarity, on Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) data.

## Project Description
The goal of this POC is to explore and demonstrate how machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be leveraged to enhance the analysis of DMV data. By applying these methods, we aim to improve the accuracy and efficiency of data processing, enabling better decision-making and insights.
### Contents
- `DMV_test.pdf`: A document containing test data that simulates real-world DMV records.
- `DMV_using_transformers_pipeline.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook demonstrating the application of transformer models to analyze the DMV data.
- `DMV_using_TFIDF_and_cosine_similarity.ipynb`: This notebook explores the use of TF-IDF and cosine similarity for text analysis within the DMV data, providing insights into the similarity between documents and helping identify patterns.
## Getting Started
To run the notebooks and explore the analyses:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the necessary Python packages, including `transformers`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `jupyter`:
```bash
pip install transformers pandas numpy scikit-learn jupyter
